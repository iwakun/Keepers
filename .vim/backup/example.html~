		Create a new model and click <strong class="gui">ProcessFlow</strong>
		in the center pane. Notice that when the Process Flow pane is open, the
		Library changes to display the Process Flow activities.
	</li>
	<!-- Find out if the process flow tab will always be open by default from now on -->
	<li>
		First, you'll need to add an activity that will create the processes
		that will move through the other activities. In this model, the processes
		will represent customers coming to the post office. Since customers will
		arrive at random, you'll use an Inter-Arrival Source to represent them.
		From the Library, under the <strong class="gui">Process Creation</strong>
		group, drag an <strong class="gui">Inter-Arrival Source</strong> activity
		into the process flow.

	</li>
	<li>
		Now you'll add an activity that will represent a customer standing in
		line waiting to receive service from a postal worker at the service window.
		If the postal worker is busy, the customer will wait in line until the
		postal worker is free. Because the postal worker is a limited resource,
		you'll use an <strong class="gui">Acquire Resource</strong> activity for
		this step in the process flow. From the Library under the 
		<strong class="gui">Resources</strong> group, drag out an 
		<strong class="gui">Acquire Resource</strong> activity and drop it on top of the
		<strong class="gui">Source</strong> activity. Notice that the two
		activities have been snapped together, as shown in the following image.
		They are now automatically connected in a <em>block</em> (also sometimes
		referred to as a <em>stacked block</em>.) See 
		<a href="../About/KeyTerms.html#Block">Blocks and Stacked Blocks</a>
		for more information.

	</li>
	<li>
		Now you'll try the second method for adding and connecting an activity
		using a a connection coming out from the stacked block. Point your mouse on
		the bottom edge of the block. The mouse icon will change to a chain link.
		<img src="../Images/Connection.png"> Click the edge of the block and, while
		holding down the mouse, drag it a little bit toward the bottom of the
		screen. Notice that there is a connector coming from the edge of the block
		to your mouse pointer. When you release the mouse, the <strong
		class="gui">Activity Select</strong> menu will appear, as shown in the
		following image.
	</li>
	<li>
		Under the <strong class="gui">Basic</strong> group, click the 
		<strong class="gui">Delay</strong> activity 
		<img src="../../bitmaps/delayiconlarge.png"/>,
		as shown in the following image.
